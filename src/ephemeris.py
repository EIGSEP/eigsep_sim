"""Solar-system body ephemeris for external radio sources (Sun, Earth, ...).

Companion to :mod:`observer` — where ``Observer`` subclasses give the
spacecraft's *own* position/attitude, this module gives the position of
everything else (Sun, Earth) relative to the Moon, in the same inertial
galactic frame used throughout the rest of the package (``ICRS2GAL``).

Uses astropy's built-in low-precision analytical ephemeris
(``get_body_barycentric``) — no external kernel download required, and
accurate to well under a HEALPix pixel at ``nside <= 64`` (~1 deg), which is
all that's needed to place an extended source (Sun, Earth) on the sky and
gate it by lunar occultation.  Swap in a JPL DE44x kernel via
``astropy.coordinates.solar_system_ephemeris.set('jpl')`` (requires the
``jplephem`` package and a downloaded kernel) if higher precision is ever
needed — not expected for this use case.

Note on frames: the *inertial* (galactic) direction from the Moon to Earth
sweeps a full circle roughly once per sidereal month (~27.3 days, the
Moon's orbital period around Earth) — it is only in the Moon **body-fixed**
frame (MCMF) that Earth appears nearly stationary (that's what tidal
locking means).  The Sun's inertial direction from the Moon sweeps once per
synodic month (~29.5 days); in the MCMF frame this sweep *is* the lunar
day/night cycle relevant to surface heating.
