"""Lunar regolith thermal/EM brightness model (Phase 2 realism work).

Companion to :mod:`ephemeris` (real Sun geometry) and :mod:`sources`
(Phase 1 external sources). Where Phase 1 modelled bright *external*
sources (Sun, Earth), Phase 2 models the *regolith itself*: at 50-150 MHz
the lunar surface is not an opaque blackbody at one uniform temperature --
(a) different points on the surface have different insolation history
(day/night, latitude) so brightness varies spatially and with the lunar
day/night cycle (~29.5 d synodic period), and (b) radio emission at these
frequencies originates from some depth below the surface (the regolith is
only weakly lossy), and the physical temperature at that depth is a
damped, phase-lagged version of the surface diurnal cycle -- so LOWER
frequencies (which probe deeper) should show a SMALLER, more phase-shifted
diurnal brightness swing than higher frequencies. That frequency-dependent
spectral structure is exactly the kind of subtle systematic that could
bias or mimic a 21cm global-signal trough if unmodelled -- this module
exists to quantify it, not to claim photometric-grade absolute accuracy.

Physical constants used (each independently citable, not fit as a set):

- Bond albedo ``bond_albedo=0.12``: standard lunar value, sets the
  subsolar equilibrium temperature via simple radiative balance
  (``subsolar_equilibrium_temperature_K``); with the solar constant this
  gives ~381 K, close to the commonly cited Diviner subsolar temperature
  ~387-400 K (the residual is emissivity<1, non-Lambertian scattering,
  etc., not modelled here).
- Deep isotherm ``T_deep_K=255``: the near-equatorial subsurface
  temperature (depth >~0.5-1 m) where diurnal forcing is fully damped and
  the interior heat flow dominates, ~250-260 K (Hayne et al. 2017,
  "Global Regolith Thermophysical Properties of the Moon from the Diviner
  Lunar Radiometer Experiment", JGR Planets; Vasavada et al.-type thermal
  models report similar values). This is also, self-consistently, close
  to what a symmetric day/night average of a ~387 K subsolar peak and a
  ~100 K nightside floor gives (~243 K) -- the classic periodic-heat-
  equation solution used below preserves the *mean* of the surface
  forcing at all depths, so using the empirical deep isotherm directly is
  both better-grounded and internally consistent.
- Thermal diffusivity ``thermal_diffusivity_m2_s=1e-9``: upper lunar
  regolith value (Hayne et al. 2017); combined with the ~29.5 d synodic
  period via the classic periodic-heat-equation skin depth
  ``delta = sqrt(diffusivity * period / pi)`` this gives ~3 cm, order-of-
  magnitude consistent with the ~4-10 cm diurnal skin depth reported
  there (real regolith diffusivity increases with depth/compaction, not
  captured by this single-diffusivity model).
- Dielectric constant ``eps_r=3.0`` / loss tangent ``loss_tangent=0.005``:
  representative of published in-situ/lab lunar regolith measurements
  (permittivity ~2.6-3.9, loss tangent ~0.003-0.013; e.g. Chang'E-5
  Lunar Penetrating Radar results, Siegler et al. 2020 JGR Planets). These
  were measured at 450 MHz-37 GHz; extrapolating the standard low-loss-
  dielectric penetration-depth formula down to 50-150 MHz assumes the loss
  tangent stays roughly frequency-independent, which lab studies broadly
  support for the *real* part of the dielectric constant, while the
  *imaginary* part (and hence loss tangent) is reported to decrease
  somewhat with INCREASING frequency -- so if anything this likely
  UNDERESTIMATES the true low-frequency penetration depth. Treat
  ``em_power_penetration_depth_m`` as order-of-magnitude, not a validated
  spectrum (same caveat level as ``sources.quiet_sun_temperature_K``).

Depth-averaging derivation (``regolith_brightness_temperature_K``): model
the surface diurnal forcing as a single sinusoid (fundamental harmonic)
T(0, phase) = T_deep + dT*cos(phase), dT = T_subsolar - T_deep. This loses
the true nonlinear day-side T^(1/4) lightcurve shape, but higher harmonics
of a periodic surface forcing damp with depth faster than the fundamental
(damping length for harmonic n scales as 1/sqrt(n)), so a depth-averaged
brightness is increasingly well approximated by the fundamental alone as
depth grows -- exactly the regime this module targets. The classic
solution to the 1-D heat equation under sinusoidal forcing is
T(z, phase) = T_deep + dT * exp(-z/d_th) * cos(phase - z/d_th), where
d_th is the diurnal thermal skin depth. Averaging this against the EM
power-deposition kernel w(z) = exp(-z/d_em) (d_em = the power e-folding
penetration depth -- for a passive lossy half-space, the emergent
brightness is a depth average of the physical temperature weighted by
where the observed power actually originates) gives, via
Re[exp(i*phase) * integral of exp(-z*(1/d_th + i/d_th + 1/d_em)) dz]:

    T_eff(phase) = T_deep + dT * amp(u) * cos(phase - shift(u))

with u = d_th/d_em, amp(u) = u/sqrt((1+u)^2+1), shift(u) = atan2(1, 1+u).
As u -> infinity (d_em << d_th, i.e. very high frequency / shallow depth),
amp -> 1 and shift -> 0: recovers the undamped surface fundamental. As
u -> 0 (d_em >> d_th, very low frequency / deep), amp -> 0: recovers the
deep isotherm. A correction term (see the function body) is added so the
high-frequency limit is EXACT (matches the true nonlinear
``surface_equilibrium_temperature_K``, not just its fundamental harmonic),
damped by the same amp(u) envelope -- conservative in that real higher
harmonics damp at least as fast, so this likely slightly OVERSTATES how
long daytime peak sharpness survives with depth, not understates it.

This is a sensitivity-study model, not a validated forward model of real
regolith emission: it deliberately isolates the two qualitative effects
that matter for the science question (frequency-dependent amplitude
damping and phase lag of the diurnal brightness swing) rather than trying
to reproduce an exact lightcurve.
